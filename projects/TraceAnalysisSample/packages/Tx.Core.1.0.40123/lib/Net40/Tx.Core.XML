            <summary>
            This is like AnonimosObservable in Rx, but without the auto-detach logic

        <member name="T:System.Reactive.Demultiplexor">
            <summary>
                Efficiently demultiplexes input sequence of objects into output sequences of fixed types
                The callbacks on the output sequences are called in the order of occurence of input events
                OnNext of the Demultiplexor should not be called from multiple threads

        <member name="T:System.Reactive.PlaybackBase">
            <summary>
                Playback serves two purposes:
                (1) Replay the history from one or more trace/log files, by turning the event occurence records into C# instances
                (2) Deliver events from fixed set of real time sessions as C# instances
                The invariants that Playback preserves are:
                (a) The order within one input file/session (inputs events must be in order of occurence, and have increasing timestamps)
                (b) The illusion of global order - merging different files/streams on timestamp
